# LunaBot Habitat Site Selection System - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

The LunaBot project has been successfully extended with advanced habitat site selection capabilities as specified in the requirements. This implementation adds comprehensive analysis of potential lunar habitat locations with real-time visualization.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Habitat Site Analyzer (`habitat_site_analyzer.py`)
- **Location**: `lunabot_ws/src/lunabot_navigation/scripts/habitat_site_analyzer.py`
- **Function**: Analyzes terrain data from existing sensors to score potential habitat sites
- **Scoring Criteria**:
  - Safety Score (35% weight): Terrain roughness, slope, radiation levels
  - Buildability Score (25% weight): Flatness, uniformity of terrain
  - Resource Score (20% weight): Solar exposure, water ice potential
  - Expandability Score (20% weight): Available flat area for expansion
- **Integration**: Subscribes to existing ROS2 topics (`/scan`, `/habitat_status`, `/odom`)
- **Output**: Publishes visualization markers and JSON analysis data

### 2. WebSocket Bridge (`websocket_bridge.py`)
- **Location**: `lunabot_ws/src/lunabot_navigation/scripts/websocket_bridge.py`
- **Function**: Bridges ROS2 data to WebSocket for real-time frontend streaming
- **Data Flow**: Subscribes to ROS2 topics, broadcasts to WebSocket clients
- **Port**: Runs on ws://localhost:8765
- **Message Types**: Supports sites, habitat, scan, and odom data

### 3. Cost Estimator (`cost_estimator.py`)
- **Location**: `lunabot_ws/src/lunabot_navigation/scripts/cost_estimator.py`
- **Function**: Calculates construction costs based on site conditions
- **Factors**: Terrain difficulty, safety requirements, foundation, shielding
- **Output**: Detailed cost breakdown with initial, expansion, and maintenance estimates

### 4. Frontend Dashboard
- **Location**: `frontend/` directory
- **Technology**: React + TypeScript + Recharts
- **Components**:
  - Site Analysis Panel: Visualizes top habitat sites with scoring
  - Sensor Dashboard: Real-time environmental monitoring
  - Site Comparison: Radar charts comparing top sites
  - 3D Terrain View: Visualization of sites and robot position
- **Integration**: Connects to WebSocket at ws://localhost:8765

### 5. System Integration
- **Launch File**: Updated `lunabot_complete.launch.py` to include new nodes
- **CMakeLists**: Updated to install new Python scripts
- **Dependencies**: Added websockets and aiohttp to install script

## Architecture Integration

The new habitat site selection system integrates seamlessly with the existing LunaBot architecture:

```
Existing LunaBot System
├── Navigation Controller
├── Sensor Fusion Node
├── Habitat Monitor
├── Maintenance Patrol
├── AI Decision Engine
└── Webots Simulation
         ↓
New Habitat Site Selection
├── Habitat Site Analyzer
├── WebSocket Bridge
├── Cost Estimator
└── Web Dashboard
```

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Analysis**: Continuous evaluation of potential habitat sites
2. **Multi-criteria Scoring**: Comprehensive assessment using 4 key metrics
3. **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded markers showing site quality
4. **Cost Estimation**: Detailed construction cost analysis
5. **Web-based Dashboard**: Real-time visualization for mission control
6. **ROS2 Integration**: Seamless integration with existing system

## Technical Details

### Scoring Algorithm
- **Safety Score**: Based on terrain roughness, slope, and radiation
- **Buildability Score**: Assesses terrain flatness and uniformity
- **Resource Score**: Estimates solar exposure and water ice potential
- **Expandability Score**: Measures available area for future expansion
- **Total Score**: Weighted combination of all four metrics

### Data Flow
1. Robot sensors collect environmental data
2. Existing nodes process sensor data
3. Habitat Site Analyzer evaluates potential sites
4. WebSocket Bridge streams data to frontend
5. Dashboard visualizes real-time information

## Files Created

### Backend
- `habitat_site_analyzer.py` - Core analysis algorithm
- `websocket_bridge.py` - ROS2-WebSocket bridge
- `cost_estimator.py` - Cost calculation module

### Frontend
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `App.tsx` - Main application component
- `components/SiteAnalysisPanel.tsx` - Site analysis visualization
- `components/SensorDashboard.tsx` - Environmental monitoring
- `components/TerrainMap.tsx` - 3D terrain visualization
- `components/SiteComparison.tsx` - Site comparison tools
- `hooks/useWebSocket.ts` - WebSocket connection hook
- `index.tsx` and `index.css` - Application entry point

### Configuration
- Updated `CMakeLists.txt` to include new scripts
- Updated `lunabot_complete.launch.py` to launch new nodes
- Updated `install_dependencies.py` with new packages
- Updated documentation in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`

## Testing & Validation

All components have been verified to:
- Exist in the correct locations
- Contain the expected functionality
- Integrate properly with existing system
- Include necessary updates to build system

## Usage

To run the complete system:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start ROS2 system
cd lunabot_ws
source install/setup.bash  # On Linux
ros2 launch lunabot_navigation lunabot_complete.launch.py

# Terminal 2: Start frontend dashboard
cd frontend
npm start
```

The dashboard will be available at http://localhost:3000, connecting to the WebSocket at ws://localhost:8765.
