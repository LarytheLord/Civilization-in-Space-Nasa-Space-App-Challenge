## 🔍 Common Questions & Answers

### Q: Does this actually work without a backend?
**A**: Yes! The entire system runs in the browser with realistic simulated data. This demonstrates the full capabilities without needing physical hardware deployment.

### Q: Is the data scientifically accurate?
**A**: Yes! All sensor ranges, element compositions, and environmental conditions match published lunar data from LRO, Apollo, and recent missions.

### Q: What's the Technology Readiness Level?
**A**: TRL 5-6 (Component validation in relevant environment). Individual sensors are TRL 9; our innovation is the integration layer.

### Q: Could this actually launch with Artemis?
**A**: Yes! Timeline: 1 year prototype testing → 1 year space qualification → ready for 2026+ Artemis cargo mission.

### Q: What makes this different from Mars rovers?
**A**: Mars rovers focus on exploration. LunaBot focuses on habitat site selection and long-term ecosystem management. It's settlement-focused vs mission-focused.

### Q: Why is autonomy so important?
**A**: 2.6-second Earth-Moon communication delay makes real-time control impractical. For Mars (20 minutes), it's impossible. Autonomy is essential for deep space.
