## üí¨ Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

*"NASA takes 6 months and 50 analysts to pick one lunar landing site. LunaBot does it autonomously in 48 hours. We've built the first integrated AI decision layer that fuses 8 flight-proven sensors for real-time habitat site selection. Our multi-criteria algorithm scores sites on Safety, Resources, Construction, and Science. At $7.5M‚Äîless than 0.4% of one Artemis mission‚ÄîLunaBot prevents billions in wasted resources and enables sustainable lunar colonization. We're not building better sensors; we're building the brain that lets them think together."*
