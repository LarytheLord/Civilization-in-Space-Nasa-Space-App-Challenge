# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 - Lunar Habitat Site Selection

## Challenge: LunaBot - Autonomous Navigation Robot for Lunar Habitats

### Background
With NASA's Artemis program aiming for sustained human presence on the Moon, autonomous robotic systems that ensure habitat safety and operational reliability are vital. Given the Moon's absence of GPS, challenging environments, constrained habitat spaces, and extreme conditions, robots must navigate autonomously and perform routine maintenance tasks to support astronauts and reduce human workload.

ROS (Robot Operating System) enables modular development of robotics applications and is well-suited for prototyping autonomous navigation, mapping, and maintenance functionalities for lunar exploration missions.

### Detailed Description
Design and develop a ROS-based autonomous robot prototype capable of:
- Navigating lunar habitat environments for site selection and monitoring
- Mapping and localizing in constrained environments using sensor fusion (LiDAR, cameras, IMU)
- Detecting obstacles and hazards for safe path planning
- Analyzing potential habitat sites based on multiple criteria (safety, resources, buildability)
- Monitoring environmental parameters relevant to lunar habitat operations
- Demonstrating autonomous site selection and basic maintenance tasks

Participants must develop algorithms and ROS packages for robust autonomous navigation combined with habitat site analysis and monitoring, validated in a simulation environment with modeled lunar habitat conditions.

### Expected Solution
- ROS package(s) implementing navigation, mapping, habitat site analysis, and monitoring
- Multi-criteria scoring algorithm for habitat site selection
- Real-time data visualization dashboard
- Demonstration in simulated lunar environment
- Demo video showcasing the robot performing autonomous navigation, site analysis, and anomaly detection in the simulated habitat

### Challenge Objectives
Support NASA's Artemis program by:
- Enabling autonomous site selection for lunar habitats
- Reducing astronaut workload through robotic assistance
- Improving habitat safety through continuous monitoring
- Demonstrating advanced robotics for space exploration
