Problem Statement ID 25169 Problem Statement Title LunaBot: Autonomous Navigation of Robot for Lunar Habitats Description Background With future lunar missions aiming for sustained human presence, autonomous robotic systems that ensure habitat safety and operational reliability are vital. Given the Moonâ€™s absence of GPS, challenging environments, constrained habitat spaces, and extreme conditions, robots must navigate autonomously and perform routine maintenance tasks to support astronauts and reduce human workload. ROS (Robot Operating System) enables modular development of robotics applications and is well-suited for prototyping autonomous navigation, mapping, and maintenance functionalities. Detailed Description Design and develop a ROS-based autonomous robot prototype capable of: Navigating indoor and outdoor lunar habitat environments. Mapping and localizing in constrained environments using sensor fusion (LiDAR, cameras, IMU). Detecting obstacles and hazards for safe path planning. Monitoring habitat environmental parameters (like temperature and O2 level, etc.,) Demonstrating basic maintenance tasks such as routine patrol and alert signaling. Participants must develop algorithms and ROS packages for robust autonomous navigation combined with maintenance monitoring, validated in a simulation environment with modelled lunar habitat conditions. Expected Solution ROS package(s) implementing navigation, mapping, and maintenance monitoring. Demonstration in the simulated environment. Demo video showcasing the robot performing autonomous navigation and anomaly detection in the simulated habitat.
